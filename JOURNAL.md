# July 14th: Learned about different keyboard styles and layouts

Read online about mechanical keyboard design and layout. This guide from [Keyboard University](https://www.keyboard.university/100-courses/keyboard-sizes-layouts-gdeby) was extremely helpful. I have decided to go with a 65% because it is compact but perfectly fits my needs.
