# July 14th: Learned about different keyboard styles and layouts

Read online about mechanical keyboard design and layout. This guide from [Keyboard University](https://www.keyboard.university/100-courses/keyboard-sizes-layouts-gdeby) was extremely helpful. I have decided to go with a 65% because it is compact but perfectly fits my needs.

Finalized this layout

# July 15th: Made a rough BOM and a rough wiring

Researched about key switches and different parts that go into making a keyboard. Made a rough BOM about what is needed.
Also, I am making this one wireless using a nice nano clone!. Made a rough matrix wiring diagram through multiple iterations to meet the number of pins available.

# July 17th: Made the schematic

Made the schematic in Kicad, connecting so many switches correctly was painful.
