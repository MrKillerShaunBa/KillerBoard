# July 14th: Learned about different keyboard styles and layouts

Read online about mechanical keyboard design and layout. This guide from [Keyboard University](https://www.keyboard.university/100-courses/keyboard-sizes-layouts-gdeby) was extremely helpful. I have decided to go with a 65% because it is compact but perfectly fits my needs.

Finalized this layout

# July 15th: Made a rough BOM and a rough wiring

Researched about key switches and different parts that go into making a keyboard. Made a rough BOM about what is needed.
Also, I am making this one wireless using a nice nano clone!. Made a rough matrix wiring diagram through multiple iterations to meet the number of pins available.

# July 17th: Made the schematic

Made the schematic in Kicad, connecting so many switches correctly was painful.

# July 19th: Finished the PCB

Used keyboard layout plugin to place the components in the PCB editor. Routed everything

# July 20th: Critical mistake and fix

As it is obvious (not in the first glance) that I mistakenly built a mirror image of the keyboard. I tried to use flip and mirror but nothing worked. I had to redo the whole PCB wiring.

Changes the positions of some diodes so that they dont interfere with the stabilizers. Added some silkscreen art.

Added a switch to conserve battery.

Finalised other components like PCB receptacles, battery and power switch and added them to BOM.

Started working on the case, made the bottom. Used the hackpad guide as a reference to make this. One new thing I learned is adding an angle to improve ergonomics.
