# KillerBoard
Welcome to KillerBoard, a 65% wireless hot-swappable mechanical keyboard which is made in a sandwich mounted style. It has a 3d printed case, custom PCB and a ProMicro controller for it brains.

I got the motivation to make this when I saw other cool keyboards the people have built for ``#Highway``. Also, I loved making my [Hackpad](https://github.com/MrKillerShaunBa/BajajPad) and wanted to try making something which was bigger, better and wireless of-course.

## Featues

- 65% compact layout
- Wireless, uses Promicro Controller
- ZMK firmware
- Hotswappable
- Brown tactile switches
- 6 deg typing angle
- 3D Printed case and plate
- Sandwich mount
